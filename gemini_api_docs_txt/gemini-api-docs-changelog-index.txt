Enhanced Session Management and Reliability
Session Resumption:
Keep sessions alive across temporary network
disruptions. The API now supports server-side session state storage (for
up to 24 hours) and provides handles (session_resumption) to reconnect
and resume where you left off.
Longer Sessions via Context Compression:
Enable extended
interactions beyond previous time limits. Configure context window
compression with a sliding window mechanism to automatically manage
context length, preventing abrupt terminations due to context limits.
Graceful Disconnect Notification:
Receive a
GoAway
server
message indicating when a connection is about to close, allowing for
graceful handling before termination.
More Control over Interaction Dynamics
Configurable Voice Activity Detection (VAD):
Choose sensitivity
levels or disable automatic VAD entirely and use new client events
(
activityStart
,
activityEnd
) for manual turn control.
Configurable Interruption Handling:
Decide whether user input
should interrupt the model's response.
Configurable Turn Coverage:
Choose whether the API processes all
audio and video input continuously or only captures it when the end-user
is detected speaking.
Configurable Media Resolution:
Optimize for quality or token usage
by selecting the resolution for input media.
Richer Output and Features
Expanded Voice & Language Options:
Choose from two new voices and
30 new languages for audio output. The output language is now
configurable within
speechConfig
.
Text Streaming:
Receive text responses incrementally as they are
generated, enabling faster display to the user.
Token Usage Reporting:
Gain insights into usage with detailed
token counts provided in the
usageMetadata
field of server messages,
broken down by modality and prompt or response phases.
