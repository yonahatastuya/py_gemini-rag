Model version name patterns
Gemini models are available in either
stable
,
preview
,
latest
, or
experimental
versions.
Note:
The following list refers to the model string naming convention as of
September, 2025. Models released prior to that may have different naming
conventions. Refer to the exact model string if you are using an older model.
Stable
Points to a specific stable model. Stable models usually don't change. Most
production apps should use a specific stable model.
For example:
gemini-2.5-flash
.
Preview
Points to a preview model which may be used for production. Preview models will
typically have billing enabled, might come with more restrictive rate limits and
will be deprecated with at least 2 weeks notice.
For example:
gemini-2.5-flash-preview-09-2025
.
Latest
Points to the latest release for a specific model variation. This can be a
stable, preview or experimental release. This alias will get hot-swapped with
every new release of a specific model variation. A
2-week notice
will
be provided through email before the version behind latest is changed.
For example:
gemini-flash-latest
.
Experimental
Points to an experimental model which will typically be not be suitable for
production use and come with more restrictive rate limits. We release
experimental models to gather feedback and get our latest updates into the hands
of developers quickly.
Experimental models are not stable and availability of model endpoints is
subject to change.
