When building with the Gemini API, we recommend using the
Google GenAI SDK
.
These are the official, production-ready libraries that we develop and maintain
for the most popular languages. They are in
General Availability
and used in all our official
documentation and examples.
Note:
If you're using one of our legacy libraries, we strongly recommend you
migrate
to the Google GenAI SDK. Review the
legacy libraries
section for more
information.
If you're new to the Gemini API, follow our
quickstart guide
to get started.
Language support and installation
The Google GenAI SDK is available for the Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Go and
Java languages. You can install each language's library using package managers,
or visit their GitHub repos for further engagement:
Python
Library:
google-genai
GitHub Repository:
googleapis/python-genai
Installation:
pip install google-genai
JavaScript
Library:
@google/genai
GitHub Repository:
googleapis/js-genai
Installation:
npm install @google/genai
Go
Library:
google.golang.org/genai
GitHub Repository:
googleapis/go-genai
Installation:
go get google.golang.org/genai
Java
Library:
google-genai
GitHub Repository:
googleapis/java-genai
Installation: If you're using Maven, add the following to your dependencies:
<dependencies>
<dependency>
<groupId>com.google.genai</groupId>
<artifactId>google-genai</artifactId>
<version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
</dependencies>
C#
Library:
Google.GenAI
GitHub Repository:
googleapis/go-genai
Installation:
dotnet add package Google.GenAI
General availability
We started rolling out Google GenAI SDK, a new set of libraries to access Gemini
API, in late 2024 when we launched Gemini 2.0.
As of May 2025, they reached General Availability (GA) across all supported
platforms and are the recommended libraries to access the Gemini API. They are
stable, fully supported for production use, and are actively maintained. They
provide access to the latest features, and offer the best performance working
with Gemini.
If you're using one of our legacy libraries,
we strongly recommend you migrate so that you can access the latest features and
get the best performance working with Gemini. Review the
legacy libraries
section for more information.
Legacy libraries and migration
If you are using one of our legacy libraries, we recommend that you
migrate to the new libraries
.
The legacy libraries don't provide access to recent features (such as
Live API
and
Veo
) and are on
a deprecation path. They will stop receiving updates on November 30th,
2025, the feature gaps will grow and potential bugs may no longer get fixed.
Each legacy library's support status varies, detailed in the following table:
Language
Legacy library
Support status
Recommended library
Python
google-generativeai
All support, including bug fixes, ends on November 30th, 2025.
google-genai
JavaScript/TypeScript
@google/generativeai
All support, including bug fixes, ends on November 30th, 2025.
@google/genai
Go
google.golang.org/generative-ai
All support, including bug fixes, ends on November 30th, 2025.
google.golang.org/genai
Dart and Flutter
google_generative_ai
Not actively maintained
Use trusted community or third party libraries, like
firebase_ai
, or access using REST API
Swift
generative-ai-swift
Not actively maintained
Use
Firebase AI Logic
Android
generative-ai-android
Not actively maintained
Use
Firebase AI Logic
Note for Java developers:
There was no legacy Google-provided Java SDK for
the Gemini API, so no migration from a previous Google library is required. You
can start directly with the new library in the
Language support and installation
section.
Prompt templates for code generation
Generative models (e.g., Gemini, Claude) and AI-powered IDEs (e.g., Cursor) may
produce code for the Gemini API using outdated or deprecated libraries due to
their training data cutoff. For the generated code to use the latest,
recommended libraries, provide version and usage guidance directly in your
prompts. You can use the templates below to provide the necessary context:
Python
JavaScript/TypeScript
